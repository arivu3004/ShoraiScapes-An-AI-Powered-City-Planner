## 🎯 How to Use the AI Planner

### Step 1: Input Your City Parameters
Fill in the form on the Planner page:
- **Population**: Enter your city's population
- **Temperature**: Average temperature in Celsius
- **Weather**: Select the climate type
- **Roads**: Rate current road infrastructure

### Step 2: Generate Layout
Click "Generate Layout" button and wait for AI analysis (5-10 seconds)

### Step 3: Analyze Results
Review the generated layout which includes:
- **Visual Grid**: Color-coded zones (Residential, Commercial, Parks, Industrial)
- **Density Analysis**: How crowded your city will be
- **Road Design**: Recommended road widths (1-4 levels)
- **Amenities**: Suggested parks, hospitals, transit hubs, etc.
- **Recommendations**: Strategic development advice

### Step 4: Extract Insights
Use the recommendations for:
- Urban planning decisions
- Infrastructure investment planning
- Amenity distribution
- Traffic management strategies

## 📊 Understanding the Layout Grid

The visualization uses a 10x10 grid with color coding:

| Color | Zone Type | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Gray | Roads | Transportation network |
| Yellow | Residential | Housing areas |
| Red | Commercial | Shopping, offices, businesses |
| Green | Parks & Green Space | Recreation, environment |
| Dark Gray | Industrial | Manufacturing, logistics |

## 💡 Example Scenario

**Input:**
- Population: 250,000
- Temperature: 28°C
- Weather: Tropical
- Roads: Normal

**Expected Output:**
- Density: High
- Road Width: Level 3/4 (wider roads needed)
- Amenities: Parks, Shopping malls, Water fountains, Cooling centers, Public transit
- Recommendations: Implement multi-level parking, develop rapid transit system, maximize green spaces

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Port 5000 already in use?**
- Edit `backend/app.py`, line: `app.run(port=5001)`

**Module import errors?**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

**Layout not generating?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- All form fields must be filled
- Population should be between 1,000 and 10,000,000+

**Page not loading?**
- Make sure Flask server is running
- Try clearing browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Use incognito/private mode
